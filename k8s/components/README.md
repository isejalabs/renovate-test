## Purpose

One of the main goals of this folder is to provide a set of common components that can be used across multiple applications and environments, reducing duplication and promoting consistency.

A typical use case is transforming the domain name `example.com` defined in the applications' base configuration to `your.sub.domain.com` across all applications and environments. Another use case is setting common labels, annotations, or resource limits.

These components can then be included in the `kustomization.yaml` files of individual applications and environments, allowing for easy customization and extension.
